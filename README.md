# Image-classification-using-CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to  classify images as either cats or dogs and further identify their specific breeds. The system first detects the animal type,  then uses a dedicated model to predict the breed. A simple GUI allows users to upload images and view the predicted  animal type, breed, and confidence score.
